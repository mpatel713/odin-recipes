        The first bite of lemon crumb cake is a symphony of sensations. As the fork glides through the moist,
         lemon-infused cake, a burst of citrusy aroma fills the air, promising a tangy delight. With each 
         tender morsel melting on the tongue, the sweet and zesty flavors dance together, creating a 
         harmonious balance. The crumb topping adds a satisfying crunch, a contrast to the softness beneath. 
         I can almost hear the gentle crackle as it breaks apart. The sight of the golden crumbs against the 
         pale yellow cake is inviting, and the touch of the delicate, crumbly texture is a tactile pleasure. 
         This cake is not just a treat for the taste buds; it's a full sensory experience, leaving a 
         lingering, mouthwatering sensation long after the last bite is savored. With each bite, the burst of 
         lemony flavor awakens the taste buds, while the fluffy cake practically melts in your mouth, leaving 
         a sweet, tangy aftertaste that lingers on the palate. The aroma alone is enticing, a mix of fresh 
         citrus and warm, buttery goodness that fills the room and beckons you closer. As you take another 
         forkful, the sound of the crumbly topping breaking apart is music to your ears, and the sight of the 
         delicate cake beneath is simply irresistible. This lemon crumb cake is more than just a dessert; 
         it's a sensory journey that satisfies every sense, from the first glance to the very last crumb.

        <li>Make crumb topping by combining 1 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons lemon zest, 1 teaspoon 
            lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cut in cold butter until mixture resembles coarse sand. Set aside.</li>
